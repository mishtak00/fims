FIMs stands for formatted internal metrics. This is one of my developments for the CTSI at URMC. This notebook is useful for taking RedCap raw survey data on CTSI reported internal metrics as input in CSV format, processing it, and finally exporting it in a human-consumable PDF format that's pleasant to the eye. It works for the years spanning the survey time frame, i.e. 2017-2020.
